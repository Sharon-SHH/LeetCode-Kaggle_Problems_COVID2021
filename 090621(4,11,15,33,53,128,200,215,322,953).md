<span style='color:red'> 88. Merge Sorted Array (Easy)  (__A warm-up__) </span>  
You are given two integer arrays __nums1__ and __nums2__, sorted in __non-decreasing order__, and two integers __m__ and __n__, representing the number of elements in __nums1__ and __nums2__ respectively.

Merge __nums1__ and __nums2__ into a single array sorted in __non-decreasing order__.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be *stored inside the array* __nums1__. To accommodate this, __nums1__ has a length of __m + n__, where the first __m__ elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last __n__ elements are set to __0__ and should be ignored. __nums2__ has a length of __n__.

<span style='color:red'> 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays (Hard) </span>  
Given two sorted arrays __nums1__ and __nums2__ of size __m__ and __n__ respectively, return __the median__ of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be __O(log (m+n))__.

<span style='color:red'> 11. Container With Most Water (Medium) </span>  
Given __n__ non-negative integers __a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>__, where each represents a point at coordinate __(i, ai)__. __n__ vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line __i__ is at __(i, ai)__ and __(i, 0)__. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

<span style='color:red'> 15. 3Sum (Medium) </span>  
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets __[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]__ such that __i != j, i != k,__ and __j != k__, and __nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0__.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

<span style='color:red'>  33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array (Medium) </span>  
There is an integer array __nums__ sorted in ascending order (with __distinct__ values).

Prior to being passed to your function, __nums__ is __rotated__ at an unknown pivot index __k (0 <= k < nums.length)__ such that the resulting array is __[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed)__. For example, __[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]__ might be rotated at pivot index __3__ and become __[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]__.

Given the array __nums__ __*after*__ the rotation and an integer __target__, return the index of __target__ *if it is in* __nums__, or __-1__ if *it is not in* __nums__.

You must write an algorithm with __O(log n)__ runtime complexity.

<span style='color:red'>  53. Maximum Subarray (Easy) </span>  
Given an integer array __nums__, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A __subarray__ is a __contiguous__ part of an array.

<span style='color:red'> 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
 (Medium) </span>  
 Given an unsorted array of integers __nums__, return *the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence*.

You must write an algorithm that runs in __O(n)__ time.


<span style='color:red'> 200. Number of Islands (Medium) </span>  
Given an __m x n__ 2D binary grid __grid__ which represents a map of __'1'__s (land) and __'0'__s (water), return *the number of islands*.

An __island__ is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

<span style='color:red'> 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array (Medium) </span>  
Given an integer array __nums__ and an integer __k__, return the __k<sup>th</sup>__ largest element in the array.

Note that it is the __k<sup>th</sup>__ largest element in the sorted order, not the __k<sup>th</sup>__ distinct element.

<span style='color:red'> 322. Coin Change
 (Medium) </span>  
 You are given an integer array __coins__ representing coins of different denominations and an integer __amount__ representing a total amount of money.

Return *the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount*. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return __-1__.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

<span style='color:red'> 953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary (Easy) </span>  
In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different __order__. The __order__ of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of __words__ written in the alien language, and the __order__ of the alphabet, return __true__ if and only if the given __words__ are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.
