<span style='color:red'>  5. Longest Palindromic Substring (Medium) -- Recommend</span>  
Given a string __s__, return *the longest palindromic substring* in __s__.

<span style='color:red'> 13. Roman to Integer (Easy)</span>  
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: __I, V, X, L, C, D__ and __M__.

    Symbol       Value
    I             1
    V             5
    X             10
    L             50
    C             100
    D             500
    M             1000
For example, __2__ is written as __II__ in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. __12__ is written as __XII__, which is simply __X + II__. The number __27__ is written as __XXVII__, which is __XX__ + __V__ + __II__.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not __IIII__. Instead, the number four is written as __IV__. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as __IX__. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- __I__ can be placed before __V__ (5) and __X__ (10) to make 4 and 9.
- __X__ can be placed before __L__ (50) and __C__ (100) to make 40 and 90.
- __C__ can be placed before __D__ (500) and __M__ (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

<span style='color:red'> 68. Text Justification (Hard) </span>  
Given an array of strings __words__ and a width __maxWidth__, format the text such that each line has exactly __maxWidth__ characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces __' '__ when necessary so that each line has exactly __maxWidth__ characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

Note:
- A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
- Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
- The input array __words__ contains at least one word.

<span style='color:red'> 151. Reverse Words in a String (Medium) </span>  
Given an input string __s__, reverse the order of the __words__.

A __word__ is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The __words__ in __s__ will be separated by at least one space.

Return *a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space*.

__Note__ that __s__ may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.
