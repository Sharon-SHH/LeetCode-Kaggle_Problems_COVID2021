### Type: String. Question numbers: 3, 8, 10, 22, 97, 179, 451, 516
<span style='color:red'>  3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Medium) </span>  
Given a string __s__, find the length of the __longest substring__ without repeating characters.

<span style='color:red'>  8. String to Integer (atoi) (Medium) </span>  
Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

1. Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit charcter or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. __"123" -> 123__, __"0032" -> 32__). If no digits were read, then the integer is __0__. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range __[-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1]__, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than __-2<sup>31</sup>__ should be clamped to __-2<sup>31</sup>__, and integers greater than __2<sup>31</sup> - 1__ should be clamped to __2<sup>31</sup> - 1__.
6. Return the integer as the final result.

Note:

- Only the space character __' '__ is considered a whitespace character.
- __Do not ignore__ any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

<span style='color:red'> 10. Regular Expression Matching (Hard)</span>  
Given an input string __s__ and a pattern __p__, implement regular expression matching with support for __'.'__ and __'*'__ where:

- __'.'__ Matches any single character.​​​​
- __'*'__ Matches zero or more of the preceding element.  
The matching should cover the __entire__ input string (not partial).

<span style='color:red'> 22. Generate Parentheses (Medium)</span>  
Given __n__ pairs of parentheses, write a function to *generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses*.

<span style='color:red'> 97. Interleaving String (Medium)</span>  
Given strings __s1, s2,__ and __s3__, find whether __s3__ is formed by an interleaving of __s1__ and __s2__.

An interleaving of two strings __s__ and __t__ is a configuration where they are divided into __non-empty__ substrings such that:

- s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
- t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
- |n - m| <= 1
- The interleaving is __s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...__

Note: __a + b__ is the concatenation of strings __a__ and __b__.

<span style='color:red'> 179. Largest Number (Medium)</span>  
Given a list of non-negative integers __nums__, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

__Note__: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

<span style='color:red'> 451. Sort Characters By Frequency (Medium)</span>  
Given a string __s__, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters, and return *the sorted string*.

<span style='color:red'> 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence (Medium)</span>  
Given a string __s__, find *the longest palindromic __subsequence__'s length in __s__*.

A __subsequence__ is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
